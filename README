NAME
    WWW::Postmark - API for the Postmark mail service for web applications.

VERSION
    version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
            use WWW::Postmark;

            my $api = WWW::Postmark->new('api_token');
        
            # or, if you want to use SSL
            my $api = WWW::Postmark->new('api_token', 1);

            # send an email
            $api->send(from => 'me@domain.tld', to => 'you@domain.tld, them@domain.tld',
            subject => 'an email message', body => "hi guys, what's up?");

DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Postmark module provides a simple API for the Postmark web
    service, that provides email sending facilities for web applications.
    Postmark is located at <http://postmarkapp.com>. It is a paid service
    that charges according the amount of emails you send (right now first
    1,000 emails are free), and requires signing up in order to receive an
    API token.

    You can send emails either through HTTP or HTTPS with SSL encryption.
    You can send your emails to multiple recipients at once (but there's a
    20 recipients limit). If WWW::Postmark receives a successful response
    from the Postmark service, it will return a true value; otherwise it
    will die.

    To make it clear, Postmark is not an email marketing service for sending
    email campaigns or newsletters to multiple subscribers at once. It's
    meant for sending emails from web applications in response to certain
    events, like someone signing up to your website.

    Postmark provides a test API token that doesn't really send the emails.
    The token is 'POSTMARK_API_TEST', and you can use it for testing
    purposes (the tests in this distribution use this token).

METHODS
  new( $api_token, [$use_ssl] )
    Creates a new instance of this class, with a Postmark API token that
    you've received from the Postmark app. By default, requests are made
    through HTTP; if you want to send them with SSL encryption, pass a true
    value for $use_ssl.

  send( from => 'you@mail.com', to => 'them@mail.com', subject => 
'An email message', body => $message_body, [ cc => 'someone@mail.com',
bcc => 'otherone@mail.com, anotherone@mail.com', tag => 'sometag',
reply_to => 'do-not-reply@mail.com' ] )
    Receives a hash representing the email message that should be sent and
    attempts to send it through the Postmark service. If the message was
    successfully sent, a true value is returned; otherwise, this method will
    croak with an approriate error message (see ""ERRORS" for a full list).

    The following keys are required when using this method:

    *   from

        The email address of the sender. Either pass the email address
        itself in the format 'mail_address@domain.tld' or also provide a
        name, like 'My Name <mail_address@domain.tld>'.

    *   to

        The email address(es) of the recipient(s). You can use both formats
        as in 'to', but here you can give multiple addresses. Use a comma to
        separate them. Note, however, that Postmark limits this to 20
        recipients and sending will fail if you attempt to send to more than
        20 addresses.

    *   subject

        The subject of your message.

    *   body

        The body of your message. This could be plain text, or HTML. If you
        want to send HTML, be sure to open with '<html>' and close with
        '</html>'. This module will look for these tags in order to find out
        whether you're sending a text message or an HTML message.

    You can optionally supply the following parameters as well:

    *   cc, bcc

        Same rules as the 'to' parameter.

    *   tag

        Can be used to label your mail messages according to different
        categories, so you can analyze statistics of your mail sendings
        through the Postmark service.

    *   reply_to

        Will force recipients of your email to send their replies to this
        mail address when replying to your email.

INTERNAL METHODS
    The following methods are only to be used internally.
